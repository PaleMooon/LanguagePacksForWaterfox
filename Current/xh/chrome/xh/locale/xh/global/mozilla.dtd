Iqalise ngokushukumisa <em>swiftly</em>, yaza yaba namandla ngakumbi, yaqhuba iziphindaphinda. And the beasts brought <em>fire</em> nokukhanya ebumnyameni.">

'The Beast adopted <em>new raiment</em> and studied the ways of <em>Time</em> and <em>Space</em> 
and <em>Light</em> and the <em>Flow</em> of energy through the Universe. From its studies, 
the Beast fashioned new structures from <em>oxidised metal</em> and proclaimed their glories. 
And the Beastâ€™s followers rejoiced, finding renewed purpose in these <em>teachings</em>.'>
